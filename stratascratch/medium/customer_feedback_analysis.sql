-- Capital One's marketing team is working on a project to analyze customer feedback 
-- from their feedback surveys.

-- The team sorted the words from the feedback into three different categories;

-- •	short_comments
-- •	mid_length_comments
-- •	long_comments

-- The team wants to find comments that are not short and that come from social
--  media. The output should include 'feedback_id,' 'feedback_text,' 'source_channel,' 
-- and a calculated category.


SELECT 
    DISTINCT feedback_id,
    feedback_text, 
    source_channel,
    comment_category
FROM customer_feedback
WHERE comment_category != 'short_comments' AND source_channel = 'social_media'
ORDER BY feedback_id
